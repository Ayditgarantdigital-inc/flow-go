// VoteAggregator aggregates incoming votes and generates a QC if possible.
// VoteAggregator consumes the `IncorporatedBlock` event for the following reasons:
// - In order to generate a QC, VoteAggregator needs to access the nodes' stakes
// - Staking information is part of the protocol state and requires
//   that all ancestors of a block are known
// - This means that the block which is voted for needs to be in the main chain
// - as soon as a block is added to the main chain,
//   VoteAggregator is notified and can track this information

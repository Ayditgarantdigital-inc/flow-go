// Crown encapsulated Finalization Logic and ForkChoice rule in one component.
// Crown maintains an in-memory data-structure of all blocks whose view-number is larger or equal to
// the latest finalized block. The latest finalized block is defined as the finalized block with the largest view number.
// When adding blocks, Crown automatically updates its internal state (including finalized blocks).
// Furthermore, blocks whose view number is smaller than the latest finalized block are pruned automatically.
//
// PREREQUISITES:
// * From the view-point of Crown, a block B is identified by the pair (B.View, B.blockMRH)
// * Crown expects that only blocks are added that can be connected to its latest finalized block
//   (without missing interim ancestors). If this condition is violated, Crown will raise an error
//   and irgnore the block.

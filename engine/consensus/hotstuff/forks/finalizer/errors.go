// ErrorBlockHashCollision [FATAL] represents the case where two blocks have the same hash,

// if it comes across a pair of blocks with same ID (Hash) but different fields.
//
// Theoretically, there are two potential reasons for this error:
// (1) the block is invalid (manipulated) but has passed the validity check (bug);
// (2) there is a true hash collision. This is extre..e-17..emly unlikely

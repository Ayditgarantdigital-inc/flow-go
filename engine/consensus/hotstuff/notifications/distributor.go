package notifications

// Distributor consumes notifications outbound events produced by HotStuff and its components.
// Outbound events are all events that are potentially relevant to the larger node
// in which HotStuff (or Forks) is running.
// Implementation must be concurrency safe; Non-blocking;
// and must handle repetition of the same events (with some processing overhead).

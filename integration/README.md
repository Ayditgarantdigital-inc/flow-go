## Flow Integration tests

A small testing utility which uses local Docker to run a network of nodes.

Uses `github.com/m4ksio/testingdock` which is a slightly enhanced fork of some other library.
See `base_test.go` for example usage.

Run with `make integration-test` or by using IDE - its a standard unit test after all.

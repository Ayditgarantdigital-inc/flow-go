Steps to create a ticket:(remove when creating)

## 1. What problem is this solving? 
## 2. What are the proposed solutions to solve?
## 3. What tests must pass for this issue to be addressed?


Update ticket status using the following (remove the below once ticket created) 

* A. What *workstream* does this ticket deal with? Find the appropriate 'S-' label and add that label.
* B. Is it a specific *'type'* of ticket (ex: bug, documentation)? If yes, add that label as well.
* C. Is the ticket related to on *overarching theme* (ex: architecture related, performance-related)? If yes, add that label as well.
* D. Add any/all *descriptive characteristic* labels needed (ex: Needs Estimation, Needs Test Cases).
* E. Now we should determine what *release* this ticket is associated with. If none, leave it blank. If it is associated to a specific release, please add it to the appropriate release.
* F. For those tickets that are associated with a release, we want to assign it a *level of importance* to that release. These labels follow the standard MoSCoW rules (must haves, should haves, could haves, would haves). We want to look at releases and then the importance of tickets within those specific releases. So the MoSCoW label is ONLY valid when it is taken in conjunction with its release.
* G. Lastly, assign the ticket a *priority level* (High, Medium, Low) via the appropriate label. These labels control the importance of the ticket within the sprint. For example, all 'highs' should be worked on first. Then mediums then lows. This gives us an easy way to identify the order of priority of tickets within a specific sprint.

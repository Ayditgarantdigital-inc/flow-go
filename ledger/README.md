# Flow Ledger Package

**Ledger** is an stateful fork-aware key/value storage. Any update (value change for a key) to the ledger generates a new ledger state. Updates can be applied to any recent states. These changes doesn't have to be sequential and ledger supports a tree of states. Ledger provides value look up by key at particular state (historic lookups) and can prove existance/non-existance of a key value pair at the given state.  
This package provides two various implementation of ledger:

- **Complete Ledger** implements a fast, memory-efficent and reliable ledger. It holds a limited number of recenlty active states in memory (for speed) and uses write-ahead logs and checkpointing to provide reliability. Under the hood complete ledger uses a collection of MTries (forest). MTrie is a customized in-memory binary patricia merkle trie storing payloads at specific storage paths. Payload includes both key value pair and storage paths are determined by the PathFinder. Forest utilize unchanged sub-trie sharing between tries to save memory. 

- **Partial Ledger** implements the ledger functionality for for a limited subset of keys. Partial ledgers are designed to be constructed and verified by a collection of proofs from a complete ledger. Partial ledger uses a partial binary merkle trie which holds intermediate hash value for the pruned branched and prevents updates to keys that were not part of proofs.

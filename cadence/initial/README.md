# Cadence

## Introduction

Cadence is a resource-oriented programming language that introduces new features
to smart contract programming that help developers ensure that their code is
safe, secure, clear, and approachable.

Some of these features are:

- Type safety and a strong static type system
- Resource-oriented programming, a new paradigm that pairs linear types with
  object capabilities to create a secure and declarative model for digital
  ownership by ensuring that resources (and their associated assets) can only
  exist in one location at a time, cannot be copied, and cannot be accidentally
  lost or deleted
- Built-in pre-conditions and post-conditions for functions and transactions
- The utilization of capability-based security, which enforces access control by
  requiring that access to objects is restricted to only the owner and those who
  have a valid reference to the object

## Getting Started

To get started writing Cadence, try it out in the
[Playground](https://play.onflow.org/).

If you want to develop locally, install the [Flow Command Line
Client](https://docs.onflow.org/v0.3/docs/cli), which provides the [Flow
emulator](https://docs.onflow.org/v0.3/docs/emulator) and the [Visual Studio
Code extension](https://docs.onflow.org/v0.3/docs/visual-studio-code-extension).
The emulator is a lightweight tool that emulates the behaviour of the real Flow
network. The Visual Studio Code extension enables the development, deployment
of, and interaction with Cadence contracts

## Documentation

To read more about Cadence, have a look at the language reference on the [Flow
documentation site](https://docs.onflow.org/docs/cadence) or [in this
repository](/docs#cadence-programming-language-documentation).
